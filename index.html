    <p><strong>About Me:</strong> Hello and thank you for visiting my page! 
        I am a student at BSU with 3 classes left to complete my CS major. 
        I also work at the IT desk in the Maxwell Library and enjoy providing excellent customer service to the students and faculty by helping them with their IT related issues. 
        In my time off I enjoy spending time with family, reading, gaming, working out, eating well and watching sports. 
        If you would like to know more about what I do or contact me, you can <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesse-cooper-440418229">view my linkdin profile here</a>.
